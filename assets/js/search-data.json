            "content": "learning objective . Explain the existence of undecidable problems in computer science. Basically What are undecidable problems in comp sci? . essential knowledge . What is a decidable problem? . these are problems for which algorthms could be written to solve/produce a correct output for all inputs. . num = 4 if num % 2 == 0: # divides num by 2 and checks remainder. print(&quot;is even&quot;) # if remainder is 0, num is even else: print(&quot;is odd&quot;) # if there is any remainder e.g its odd num: num is odd . is even . What is an undecidable problem? . these are problems for which no algorithms can be built that can provide a correct yes or no answer. sometimes there are algorithmic solutions for undecidable problems that can be used for a certain instance, but there won&#39;t be one algorithmic solution for all inputs of the undecidable problem. . IMPORTANT!!!! . don&#39;t worry about determining if a given problem is undecidable or not. deciding if problems are undecideable or not is outside the scope of APCSP. worry about that later in advanced CS courses . essential vocabulary . vocab term definition . undecidable problem | problems for which no algorithms can be built that can provide a correct yes or no answer or a solution | . Decidable problem | problems for which algorthms could be written to solve/produce a correct output for all inputs. | . code snippets + explanations . 2 practice problems . relate lesson to list or binary .",
