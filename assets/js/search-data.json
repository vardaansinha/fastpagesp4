            "content": "learning objective . Explain the existence of undecidable problems in computer science. Basically What are undecidable problems in comp sci? . Main idea: There exist problems that computers cannot solve, and even when a computer can solve a problem, it may not be able to do so in a reasonable amount of time. . essential knowledge . What is a decidable problem? . these are problems for which algorthms could be written to solve/produce a correct output for all inputs. . num = 4 if num % 2 == 0: # divides num by 2 and checks remainder. print(&quot;is even&quot;) # if remainder is 0, num is even else: print(&quot;is not even&quot;) # if there is any remainder e.g its odd num: num is odd . is even . What is an undecidable problem? . these are problems for which no algorithms can be built that can provide a correct yes or no answer. sometimes there are algorithmic solutions for undecidable problems that can be used for a certain instance, but there won&#39;t be one algorithmic solution for all inputs of the undecidable problem. . IMPORTANT!!!! . don&#39;t worry about determining if a given problem is undecidable or not. deciding if problems are undecideable or not is outside the scope of APCSP. worry about that later in advanced CS courses . Undecidable problem example . def fumo(): a = 0 i = 1 while a != 1: i = i + 1 print(i) fumo() # this is an undecidable problem because the function fumo never stops and thus there is no algorithm we could make to determine whether or not fumo has stopped . essential vocabulary . vocab term definition . undecidable problem | problems for which no algorithms can be built that can provide a correct yes or no answer or a solution | . Decidable problem | problems for which algorthms could be written to solve/produce a correct output for all inputs. | . practice problems . questions: . Question 1: can there be some algorithmic solutions for some inputs/instances of a undecidable problem? . Question 1.5: Are there algorithmic solutions for all inputs/instances of an undecidable problem? . Question 2: Is the following problem undecidable or decidable? . Problem: is the number given by user input greater than 20? . Question 3: the following algorithm solves the problem below. is the problem decidable or undecidable? . Problem: are there more different kinds of fruits in stock or more different kinds of vegetables in stock? . fruits = [&quot;apples&quot;, &quot;pears&quot;, &quot;apricot&quot;, &quot;tomatos&quot;] vegetables = [&quot;carrot&quot;, &quot;cauliflower&quot;, &quot;beets&quot;] if len(fruits) &gt; len(vegetables): print(&quot;yes&quot;) else: print(&quot;no&quot;) . yes . ANSWERS: true, false, decidable, decidable .",
